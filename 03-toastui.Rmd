# ToastUI Schedule ?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(toastui)
calendar(cal_demo_data("week"), view = "week", height = 1000) %>% 
cal_week_options(
  startDayOfWeek = 1,
  workweek = TRUE
) %>% 
cal_props(cal_demo_props()) 

# defaultDate = "2024-06-11"
# height - sorta hardcoding it so that it looks nice on a regular screen size

# detail popup has edit/delete buttons, but also gives a description, but we probably don't want to have edit and delete buttons, but nice to have a description (to remove, add useDetailPopup = FALSE, TRUE is default)
```

```{r}
library(toastui)
cal_demo_data("week")
```
