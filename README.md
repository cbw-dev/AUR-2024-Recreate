<h>INR 2024 - Bookdown Gitbook Implementation!</h>

This is the (Tuesday, October 8, 2024) implementation of INR 2024. Mostly everything is present.

Notes:
- All chapters that end in a question mark have (potentially) useful code (implementing a schedule, compiling python, image-text wrapping + PDF/Slidedeck implementation)
- Datasets were moved to a "datasets" folder - all read.csv calls go to the datasets folder for the correct csv file
- The Rmd headers from the completed Rmd files were just slightly edited to fit into their own chapter, the actual subheaders might be terrible
  - Also edited so that the read.csv called from the dataset folder (as mentioned above)
- There is no "imgs" file, since 3 of the images in the repo are autogenerated (not sure how to autogenerate into a different folder - probably something to add to some r chunk

Some fixes that need to be made:
- Add the actual pictures for Meet The Faculty
  - Meet the faculty headers-pronouns bug
- Figure out how to implement a schedule using the toastui library (create our own R data frame?)
- A good way to show the Course Materials

Quick Note: INR does not have any slides currently on the website, however check Julia's_LabNotes for a way to do so (essentially embedded a pdf)
